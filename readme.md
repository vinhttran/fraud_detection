<b>Motivation</b>
		One of the most difficult digital threats for companies to diagnose and eradicate is fraud. Fraudulent activity is a high-cost event that can compromise the integrity of any firm who seeks to build credibility while maximizing profit. The company being examined in this project is an online promoter of events such as concerts, parties, and shows. The objective is to detect fraud while minimizing classifying legitimate events as fraud.


<b>Business Challenges</b>
		Fraud accounts for less than 3% of all transactions making detection challenging. Over-predicting fraud would lead to excessive expenses due to the quantity of cases the firm will need to manually research. Allowing fraud into the system leads to a lack of trust and credibility.

<b>Pipeline and Feature Engineering</b>
- Focus whether a feature is complete or not (Boolean notation)
- Focus on quantity: Number of tickets sold, total quantity they are selling and payouts made previously
- Drop columns to keep each column independent properties
- Use country code and e-mail domains used by fraudsters.â€¨
